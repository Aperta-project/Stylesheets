      </p>
      <p>For the first time in the domestic pig, meiotic recombination along the 18 porcine autosomes was directly studied by immunolocalization of MLH1 protein. In total, 7,848 synaptonemal complexes from 436 spermatocytes were analyzed, and 13,969 recombination sites were mapped. Individual chromosomes for 113 of the 436 cells (representing 2,034 synaptonemal complexes) were identified by immunostaining and fluorescence <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> hybridization (FISH). The average total length of autosomal synaptonemal complexes per cell was 190.3 µm, with 32.0 recombination sites (crossovers), on average, per cell. The number of crossovers and the lengths of the autosomal synaptonemal complexes showed significant intra- (i.e. between cells) and inter-individual variations. The distributions of recombination sites within each chromosomal category were similar: crossovers in metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes were concentrated in the telomeric regions of the p- and q-arms, whereas two hotspots were located near the centromere and in the telomeric region of acrocentrics. Lack of MLH1 foci was mainly observed in the smaller chromosomes, particularly chromosome 18 (SSC18) and the sex chromosomes. All autosomes displayed positive interference, with a large variability between the chromosomes.</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">
        <hi rend="bold">Introduction</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">During meiosis, recombination between homologous chromosomes generates two kinds of recombination products: crossovers (CO) and non-crossovers (NCO). NCO result in the unidirectional transfer of short genomic segments (gene conversion) and therefore have a limited impact on genetic diversity. Conversely, CO result in the reciprocal exchange of large chromosome segments between homologues and play a major role in the genetic variability of populations. CO are also necessary for the correct segregation of chromosomes during meiosis-I <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_1">1</ref>]</ref>. Lack of CO can result in chromosomal non-disjunction, leading to the production of aneuploid gametes <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_2">2</ref>]</ref>. In the most severe cases, low levels of CO can be associated with impaired spermatogenesis <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_3">3</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_4">4</ref>].</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">Recombination sites are not distributed homogeneously along the chromosomes. Indeed, two COs very rarely occur near to one another. This phenomenon, known since 1916, has been termed "interference" <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_5">5</ref>]</ref> and different models have been proposed to explain it <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_6">6</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_7">7</ref>]. Moreover some chromosomal regions, known as recombination hotspots <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_8">8</ref>]</ref>, are preferentially affected by recombination. In Humans, 23,000 crossover hotspots, 1-2 kb in length and spaced approximately every 50-100 kb, have been identified <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_9">9-11</ref>]. They exhibit different recombination activities and are located in genic as well as in intergenic regions. Recently, the PR domain zinc finger protein 9 (PRDM9) has been shown to play a major role in the specification of such recombination hotspots in mice, humans and pigs <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_12">12</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_13">13</ref>]. PRDM9 encodes a histone methyl transferase that allows trimethylation of the H3K4 histone. Active hot spots in mice are enriched for H3K4me3 <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_14">14</ref>]</ref>. Moreover, the DNA sequence matching the predicted PRDM9 binding site is present in 40% of the hot spots identified by linkage disequilibrium <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_15">15</ref>]</ref>. </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car"><hi rend="transpan">Historically, meiotic recombination studies have relied on the physical localization of chiasmatas </hi><ref><ref target="#ENREF_16"><hi rend="transpan">16</hi></ref><hi rend="transpan">]</hi></ref><hi rend="transpan">, or on linkage analysis </hi><ref><ref target="#ENREF_17"><hi rend="transpan">17</hi></ref><hi rend="transpan">]</hi></ref><hi rend="transpan">.

      <p rend="Texte Car">The domestic pig karyotype (2n=38) is composed of 2 sex chromosomes and 18 pairs of autosomes (5 metacentrics, 7 submetacentrics and 6 acrocentrics) <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_28">28</ref>]</ref>. This karyotypic structure is relatively similar to that of Humans. For this reason, the pig species is a much better animal model for meiotic recombination studies than other mammalian species, like dogs or mice, whose karyotypes contain only acrocentric chromosomes. </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">In this paper, for the first time in the domestic pig, we present unique data on the meiotic recombination of males with normal karyotypes, obtained by direct immunocytological approach. Distribution of the MLH1 foci and the estimated strength of interference on the 18 porcine autosomal pairs were determined by identifying each autosome by multiple specific loci <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> hybridization.</p>

The relative positions of the MLH1 signals and centromeres were expressed as percentages of the total SC lengths, starting from the end of the q arms. The distances between adjacent MLH1 foci (relative distances expressed as % of total SC length) were used to estimate the interference for each chromosome.

        <hi rend="underline">Analyses of synaptonemal complex lengths </hi>
      </p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated that the physical SC lengths are continuously varying along the pachytene substages <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_37">37</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_38">38</ref>]. Therefore, knowledge of the physical (absolute) SC lengths <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> is of relatively limited interest. However, frequencies of recombination are frequently expressed in the literature in CO/µm. Consequently, such results are also given and discussed below. </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">In this study, immunocytological techniques were used to analyze 436 pachytene cells from 4 normal boars of different ages and breeds. The average total autosomal SC lengths per cell for these 4 boars are presented in table 1. High intra-individual variability was observed, (the largest for the Meishan boar, ranging from 146 µm to 268 µm). Nevertheless, the between-boar differences for this trait were highly significant (P &lt; 0.001). The difference between the two extremes (179.6 µm for Mini 1 and 199.3 µm for Meishan, respectively) represented 10% of the overall mean for this trait (190.3 µm). This value is slightly higher than the 161.5 µm already published for swine <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_39">39</ref>]</ref>. However, this latter study was conducted on a small number of spermatocytes, using electron microscopy and, as previously mentioned, high intra-individual variability could explain this difference. </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">
        <hi rend="underline">Comparison between mitotic and meiotic chromosome lengths</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">The relative lengths of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes (identified by FISH) were compared for the LW1.0 and Meish boars (table 2). Some SC were significantly longer than the corresponding mitotic chromosomes (SSC3, SSC6 and SSC14; P&lt;0.001), whereas others were significantly shorter (SSC1, SSC4, SSC5, SSC8, SSC9, and SSC11; P&lt;0.001). Nevertheless, the correlation between the two measures was very high for both individuals (r=0.953 for LW1.0 and r=0.952 for Meish). Similarly, for some chromosomes, the positions of the centromeres between the SC and mitotic chromosomes differed significantly (table 2). These results demonstrated that, for a given SC, the variation in length (between the mitotic chromosome and SC) on a chromosome arm was independent of the variation in length on the other arm. Similar results were obtained in Humans and mice <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_20">20</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_40">40</ref>]. Differences in GC content and gene density between chromosomes have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">
        <hi rend="underline">Number of MLH1 foci per cell </hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">The number of MLH1 foci per spermatocyte was estimated by analysing 436 meiocytes from the 4 boars (table 1). The overall distribution was Gaussian with an average number of 32.0 ± 4.5 MLH1 foci per cell. </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">Considerable intra-individual variability (between cells) was again observed in the number of MLH1 foci per spermatocyte (from 21 to 40 MLH1 foci per cell for the Meishan boar, for example). Large differences were also observed between individuals. Nevertheless, only the value obtained for the minipig boar (Mini 1) differed significantly from the others. Similar results had already been obtained in Humans <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_40">40-42</ref>], mice <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_43">43</ref>]</ref> and in former pig studies based on genetic (linkage) analyses <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_13">13</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_44">44</ref>]. In the pig study by Vingborg et al. (2009) <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_44">44</ref>]</ref>, the estimated total recombination length was 1,441 cM (centi Morgan, genetic map unit), i.e. 18% lower than the 1,760 cM found in the study by Tortereau et al. (2012) <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_13">13</ref>]</ref>. Considering that one recombination event corresponds to 50 cM, the total recombination length estimated in our study ranged from 1,509 cM to 1,866 cM (for LW 1.0 and Mini 1, respectively). These results are consistent with those of Vingborg <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> (2009) <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_44">44</ref>]</ref> and Tortereau <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> (2012) <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_13">13</ref>]</ref>.</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">
        <hi rend="underline">Number of MLH1 foci per autosome</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">By combining immunostaining and FISH experiments, we were able to determine the number of MLH1 foci per individual chromosome for two animals (LW1.0 and Meish; table 3). One hundred and thirteen cells representing 2034 bivalents were analyzed. As expected, the average number of MLH1 signals was higher for the large chromosomes than for the small ones. Comparisons between the two boars did not reveal any difference in the number of MLH1 foci per chromosome (P&gt;0.05) except for SSC 15. These results suggest that, for 2 individuals with a comparable total number of MLH1 foci per cell, the number of foci per chromosome remains identical.</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">
        <hi rend="underline">Lack of MLH1 foci on some bivalents</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">The lack of MLH1 signals on some bivalents (autosome or sex bivalent) was noted (table 1). Sex bivalents never presented more than one MLH1 signal, and an absence of MLH1 signal was particularly frequent (from 26 to 39%) on this particular bivalent as compared with the other chromosomes (from 1.2 to 2.8%). Comparable results were obtained in human studies, which also revealed great variability between individuals (9 to 44% of sex chromosomes without MLH1 foci <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_45">45</ref>]</ref>). It has been suggested that the sex bivalent XY is predisposed to nondisjunction due to a frequent lack of recombination in the pseudoautosomal region <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_46">46</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_47">47</ref>]. This is consistent with the higher rates of aneuploidy estimated for sex chromosomes as compared with autosomes <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_48">48</ref>]</ref>. However, the proportions of XY bivalents lacking MLH1 signals are much higher than the aneuploidy rates of sex chromosomes reported in Man and pigs (in sperm as well as in newborn <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_30">30</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_49">49-51</ref>]). This suggests that a certain proportion of germ cells lacking the MLH1 signal on the XY bivalent are eliminated during spermatogenesis. On the other hand, these high rates of XY bivalents without any MLH1 signal observed in our study, as well as in previous human studies, could also be due, in part, to technical problems (limited accessibility of the MLH1 antibodies to this specific bivalent due to their particular shape and molecular environment, higher rate of hybridization failure due to the limited size of the pseudoautosomal region, …). This specific point has not been documented so far, and should be investigated further.</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">In contrast to results obtained in humans <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_52">52</ref>], we did not observe any obvious relationship between the frequency of spermatocytes lacking MLH1 signals in the XY bivalents and the total number of MLH1 signals per cell (table 1). However, it is very difficult to document a relationship between two variables using only 4 points (individuals). Complementary data are required to document this point more thoroughly. We also compared, for each individual, the total numbers of autosomal MLH1 signals per cell: (a) in cells with one MLH1 signal on the XY bivalent, and (b) in cells without any MLH1 signal on the XY bivalent. The (a - b) difference was positive in all cases, but low and statistically different from zero for 2 boars only: (a-b)=1.6 (P=0.06) for LW1.0 ; (a-b)=0.6 (P=0.39) for LWxCr ; (a-b)=1.3 (P=0.03) for Meish and (a-b)=2.9 (P=0.01) for Mini1. </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">The frequencies of autosomes without any MLH1 signal were much lower, and varied from 1.2% to 2.8% between individuals, as indicated previously (table 1). These proportions are comparable to those observed in mice (4%, <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_18">18</ref>]</ref>), dog (0.5%, <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_26">26</ref>]</ref>) and shrew (0.7%,<ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_24">24</ref>]</ref>). The lack of MLH1 signal mainly concerned the small chromosomes, with 87% of them being observed on SSC5, SSC10, SSC11, SSC12, SSC16, SSC17 and SSC18. The smallest pig autosome (SSC 18) aggregated on its own 29% of the cases. Similar results have been reported in humans <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_45">45</ref>]</ref>, where the absence of MLH1 signal was most frequently observed for one of the smallest chromosomes (HSA 22).</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">
        <hi rend="underline">Relationship between the number of MLH1 foci and the SC length</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">Relationships between the total number of MLH1 foci per cell and the total SC length per cell were analyzed for each individual (figure 2). The two variables were positively, albeit (very) moderately, correlated (the correlation was positive but not statistically different from 0 for the LW1.0 boar). Comparable results have been obtained in human studies (correlation values ranging from 0.02 to 0.69 <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_53">53</ref>]</ref>).</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">In our study, the average total autosomal SC length per cell was 190.3 µm, for an average of 32.0 MLH1 foci per cell. This gives, on average, one MLH1 signal every 5.9 µm which is comparable to the results obtained in humans (1 focus/6.0µm, <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_21">21</ref>]), dogs (1 focus/6.2µm, <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_26">26</ref>]</ref>), mink (1focus/6.3µm, <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_25">25</ref>]</ref>) and shrew (1 focus/6.5µm, <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_24">24</ref>]</ref>) but quite different from those  obtained for the cat (1foci/4.6µm, <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_23">23</ref>]</ref>) and mouse (1 foci/7.1µm, <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_20">20</ref>]). However, considerable variability was observed between individuals (which were of different genotypes), ranging from 4.8/µm for Mini 1 to 6.5/µm for Meish. Studies carried out in mice <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_43">43</ref>]</ref> suggested that the between-strain differences in crossover levels were associated with  a variation in the length of the meiotic axes (smaller DNA loops and longer SCs in the strains exhibiting large numbers of MLH1 foci per cell). Our results (table 1) do not support this hypothesis since boars with the lowest total SC lengths per cell (Mini1 and LWxCr) presented the highest rates of recombination (37.33 and 31.37 MLH1 foci per cell, respectively). Thus, the variability in the total number of MLH1 foci observed between the four boars cannot be fully explained by the variability in the total autosomal SC lengths, and vice versa. Another explanation for the between-boar difference would be that the overall genetic background could regulate SC length independently of CO formation. As mentioned in the introduction, allelic variation for PRDM9 has been associated with hotspot activity in mice and humans <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_12">12</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_54">54</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_55">55</ref>]. Variation of RNF212 alleles also affects genome-wide recombination in humans <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_56">56-58</ref>]. Such allelic variations could explain part of the inter-individual variation of the MLH1 foci number observed in our study. No data supporting this hypothesis could be found in the literature for the pig species. This should be investigated in the near future.</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">The relationships between the number of MLH1 foci and the absolute SC length (in µm) were also analyzed using the data obtained for each bivalent independently (table 3). As expected, the two variables were highly correlated in the two studied animals (r=0.936 and r= 0.912 for LW 1.0 and Meish, respectively). A similar relationship has already been observed in other mammals <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_21">21</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_59">59</ref>]. In order to determine whether this relationship was comparable in acrocentric and non-acrocentric (i.e. metacentric and submetacentric) chromosomes, data from the two individuals (LW 1.0, and Meish) were pooled (to increase the number of observations per chromosome category). This pooling of data from two different individuals obliged us to consider relative SC lengths instead of absolute SC lengths in the subsequent analyses. The obtained correlations were slightly higher when acrocentric and non-acrocentric chromosomes were considered separately (r=0.957 and r=0.943, respectively) as compared with r=0.924 when all the autosomes were considered simultaneously. As shown in figure 3, the linear regression lines of the number of MLH1 foci (Y) on the length of SC (X) for the two kinds of chromosomes presented similar slopes (P=0.89) but significantly different intercepts (higher for non-acrocentric; P&lt;0.05). This indicates that, in general, metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes present higher recombination rates than acrocentrics. However, results obtained in other species indicate a different situation when the metacentric chromosome results from a fusion between 2 acrocentrics. Indeed, studies of individuals from different mice species or from bovidae differing only in the presence of Robertsonian translocations, revealed a reduction of recombination on the fused acrocentric chromosomes (which became metacentric), as compared to the free initial acrocentric chromosomes <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_22">22</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_60">60</ref>]. Different Robertsonian translocations have been identified in several young boars controlled in our laboratory <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_61">61</ref>]. This should provide us with an opportunity to more thoroughly document this point in the near future.</p>

        <hi rend="underline">Distributions of the MLH1 foci on individual chromosomes</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">The distributions of MLH1 foci for some representative chromosomes of LW1.0 are presented in figure 4, and for the 18 autosomes of the two analyzed boars in figure S1. Overall, the MLH1 foci distributions were not uniform. As already reported in the literature, the CO were concentrated in specific areas known as recombination hotspots. The two main hotspots for non-acrocentric chromosomes were located in telomeric regions, one on the p-arm, and the other on the q-arm. Conversely, the frequencies of MLH1 foci in the centromeric regions of non-acrocentric chromosomes were generally low (even an absence was noted for some chromosomes, SSC 11 for instance). Significantly different distributions were observed for acrocentrics. Two hotspots were frequently observed in this kind of chromosomes, as in non-acrocentrics, but one was located close to the centromeres. Similar recombination patterns were obtained in pigs by Tortereau et al. (2012) using high-density linkage map analysis <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_13">13</ref>]</ref>. These results seemed to indicate that, in acrocentric chromosomes, the centromere does not hinder the formation of CO in the porcine male, in contrast to other mammalian species like dogs <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_26">26</ref>]</ref>. For these latter, it was proposed that recombination in the centromeric regions might interfere with kinetochore assembly, and that a reduction of recombination in these regions could prevent this phenomenon. However, it has been shown that the swine DNA sequences in the centromeric regions differ between acrocentric and non-acrocentric chromosomes. More precisely, the acrocentric swine subgenome presents a higher degree of DNA sequence homogenization (nature of sequences and copy number) than the metacentric one <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_33">33</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_62">62</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_63">63</ref>]. This could provide an explanation for the difference observed between the two species. </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">Positive correlations between sequence parameters (GC content, repetitive elements content and short sequence) and recombination rate have been reported in humans <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_64">64</ref>], mice <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_65">65</ref>]</ref>, dogs <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_66">66</ref>] and pigs <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_13">13</ref>]</ref>. Considering that the relationship between the SC length and CO frequency is also positive (figure 3), this would imply that chromosomes with high GC content would present longer SC than expected from the corresponding mitotic chromosomes, as well as high levels of recombination. Our results, presented in figure 5, confirm these predictions. Indeed, SSC3, SSC6 and SSC14 have a high GC content and are longer than their corresponding mitotic chromosomes, in contrast to SSC1 and SSC8. Moreover, SSC3 and SSC6, for example, present higher levels of recombination than SSC 1 (0.68 cM/Mb, 0.66 cM/Mb and 0.42 cM/Mb respectively).</p>

        <hi rend="underline">Analysis of Interference</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">The interference parameter for the different porcine autosomes was estimated from the pooled results of the 2 individuals analyzed (figure 6). The MLH1 interfoci distances were expressed as the distances between two adjacent MLH1 foci in percentages of the SC lengths. As for numerous other organisms <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_19">19</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_67">67</ref>], the gamma model provides a good ﬁt to the inter-foci distribution for our recombination data. The estimated ʋ parameter, for all the chromosomes, was significantly greater than 1 (ranging from 4.2 for SSC1 to 44.3 for SSC10), which demonstrates a positive interference as observed in humans <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_19">19</ref>]</ref>, or mice <ref>[<ref target="#ENREF_68">68</ref>]</ref>. The level of interference differed significantly between chromosomes, the strength of interference being globally lower for large chromosomes than for small ones. This is consistent with results obtained in humans and mice <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_40">40</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_69">69</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_70">70</ref>], which indicated that the strength of interference is modulated by the SC length.</p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">The average relative distance between adjacent MLH1 foci, in all bivalents presenting only two foci (n = 1099), was 67.5% of the bivalent length (range 7.5-92.8%). This result is very close to the values reported in humans (68%,<ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_21">21</ref>]), and mice  (70%, <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_20">20</ref>]).</p>

        <hi rend="underline">Effects of the centromere on interference</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">Evidence from several species suggests that interference acts across the centromere <ref/><ref/>[<ref target="#ENREF_19">19</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_35">35</ref>, <ref target="#ENREF_71">71-73</ref>]. To document this point, the relationship between (x-axis) the distances between the centromere and the nearest MLH1 foci measured on the p arm [d (P)], and (y-axis) the distances between the centromere and the nearest MLH1 foci on the q arm [d (Q)], was  analyzed using data from SC with at least one MLH1 signal on each arm (figure 7). The distances between the centromeres and the MLH1 foci were expressed as percentages of the SC lengths. The analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the two distances (r = - 0.510; P &lt; 0.0001), confirming that interference runs across the centromere in swine chromosomes. </p>

        <hi rend="bold">Conclusion</hi>
      </p>
      <p rend="Texte Car">This article reports original and unique data concerning the direct analysis of meiotic recombination and interference in the pig species, a major agricultural as well as an interesting model species for chromosome research. The domestic pig is only the third species, after humans and mice, to have been analyzed by immunolocalization combined with chromosome specific <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> hybridization, which allowed a direct analysis of crossover frequency and distribution, as well as an estimation of the interference strength on each individual SC. Moreover, use of the immunolocalization approach made it possible to study recombination in the sexual chromosomes for the first time in pigs. Some important results already obtained in humans and/or mice have been confirmed, whereas others were more specific to pig chromosomes, as for instance the difference in recombination rates between acrocentric and non-acrocentric chromosomes (lower rate for acrocentrics). This work provides us with reference data concerning meiotic recombination and interference in normal pigs. Further work will be carried out in our group to i) produce comparable data for the female meiosis, and ii) document the impact of different kinds of chromosomal rearrangements on recombination and interference.</p>
